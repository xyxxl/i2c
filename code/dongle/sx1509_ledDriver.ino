   This example shows how you can use the following SX1509 
   library methods:
     constructor - initialize an instance of the SX1509 library.
       The minimum required parameter is the I2C address of the
       SX1509. Other parameters (resetPin, interruptPin, oscPin)
       are optional (as shown).
     init() - initializes the SX1509. Will perform a reset, start
       up the Wire library and read some registers to make sure
       the SX1509 is operational.
     ledDriverInit
     pwm
     blink
     sync

    Hardware: The SX1509 should be hooked up like so:
    SX1509 Pin      Arduino Pin
       3.3V ---------- 3.3V
       GND ----------- GND
       SDA ----------- A4 (or SDA on newer boards)
       SCL ----------- A5 (or SCL on newer boards)
       nRST ---------- 8 (could be any digital pin)
       OSCIO, and nINT are not used in this example.
   
   See the SX1509_ADDRESS defines to decide which address you need
   to send to the constructor. By default the SX1509 Breakout
   sets both ADDR pins to 0 (so 0x3E I2C address).

   In addition SX1509 i/o pins are used to drive LEDs. These
   pins should be sinking current to an LED. So the LED should be
   pulled (through a current-limiting resistor) to 3.3V.
     14 - Breathing output (pins 4-7 and 12-15 can breath)
     3  - Blinking output (any i/o pin can blink)
     0 - PWM output (any i/o pin can pwm)
